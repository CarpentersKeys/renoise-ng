# Renoise NG #

Assorted scripts and such for use with the [Renoise](http://renoise.com) DAW/tracker.

Likely candidates for inclusion here:

* Modified `GlobalOscActions.lua`
* Screens for use by the [Control](https://github.com/charlieroberts/Control) OSC/MIDI app
* Renoise tools or scripts or maybe custom instruments
